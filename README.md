# My personal website

# Visit it @ [tumasr.ai](tumasr.ai)

Some features:

-- Entirely Reactive Progressive Web App (PWA)

-- Dark mode

-- Fetches from Medium API

-- links you to some cool repos

-- Could deploy into Google Play / App Store with 3 command line instructions

## Use it as a template!

1. Clone the repo

2. run ``flutter create web``

3. delete any firebase files (that's where mines hosted)

4. run ``flutter pub get``.

5. Start editing out my personal info in place of yours!

### If you end up using it as a template, show your thanks by buying me a cup of coffee:
